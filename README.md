# Introductions to R and Python

This repository provides introductory materials for learning the basics of R and Python. The first interactive Colab introduces [R](https://colab.research.google.com/github/czymaraclass/intros/blob/main/Intro_to_R.ipynb)'s core logic and essential functions, while the second Colab presents a [Python](https://colab.research.google.com/github/czymaraclass/intros/blob/main/Intro_to_Python.ipynb) translation of these tasks, making it ideal for those transitioning between the two languages.
